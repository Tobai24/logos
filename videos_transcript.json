                "text": "If you open a Protestant Christian Bible and look at the table of contents, you will notice the first three quarters is a collection called the Old Testament. If you look at the list of books, you will see it is made up of 39 smaller works that are grouped into four main sections. The first five are called the Pentateuch, followed by the historical books, then the poetic books and finally the books of the prophets. Now, that seems simple enough but actually it is more complicated and way more interesting. This arrangement of the books in a single volume called the Old Testament is a later Christian tradition that develop after Jesus and the apostles. In ancient Jewish tradition these works were all on separated scrolls and were conceived of as a unified three part collection called TaNaK. It is a Hebrew acronym for \"Torah\" which means \"instruction\", \"Nevi'im\" which means \"prophets\", and \"Ketuvim\" which means \"writings\". The TaNaKh has the same books as the Protestant Old Testament but they are arranged differently. The \"Torah\" corresponds to the Pentateuch. But the \"prophets\" consist of four historical narrative books and then the 15 works named after specific prophets.",

It is referred to in ancient Jewish texts like the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Wisdom of Ben Sirach. Even Jesus of Nazareth mentioned it That is because this 3-part shape is woven into the compositional design of the scrolls themselves. If you pay attention, you will discover that every scroll has been coordinated by means of cross references that link each work into the larger 3-part collection. So, who put all these scrolls together? it was a long process. Some of the famous contributors are named, like Moses or David. But most of the authors remain anonymous. In the Bible, they are simply called \"Scribes\" or \"the Prophets\". These scrolls took shape throughout Israel's history as generations of prophetic scribes collected earlier stories and poems, integrated them into larger compositions, and then eventually shaped all of this material into the unified library of scrolls, the \"TaNaKh\". It is clear from texts in the Psalms and Prophets that these prophetic scribes believed that God's Spirit was guiding this whole process so that through these human words, God speaks to his people.",

We do not know when precisely this process was finished, but it was somewhere in the last centuries before the time of Jesus. In its final shape, the TaNaKh offers a prophetic interpretation of Israel's history that claims to reveal God's purposes to rescue the whole world. While we cannot do justice to the whole collection in one video, it is helpful to get an overview what these scrolls are all about. The Torah begins with God creating and blessing a great piece of real estate: our very good world. God entrusts it to a creature that reflects the divine image: human. Or, in Hebrew, \"Adam\". God appoints humanity to rule the world as kings and queens of creation. The question is whether they will trust God's wisdom to discern good and evil or seize autonomy and define good and evil for themselves. But there is another creature with the humans: a mysterious snake. It is in rebellion against the Creator. And it dupes the humans to foolishly rebel against God's generosity.",

From there, humanity keeps spreading and redefining good and evil. And things go downhill fast. They build cities plagued by violence and oppression, all leading to the foundation of a city called Babylon where people exalt themselves to the place of God. Now the basic plot conflict of the whole Bible is set. God wants to bless his world and rule it through humans. But now, humans are the problem. They are under the influence of evil. They are stupid and short-sighted and headed for self-destruction. This is all a setup for God's solution: We need a new kind of human. So God promises that a new human will come who won't give into the snake. In fact, he will crush it and will be crushed by it. From here, the story traces the promise lineage to a man and woman: Abraham and Sarah. God entrusts them with the same divine blessing given to humanity on page 1. So they leave Babylon to a new garden-like land that God promises to give his family.",

Our hopes are high, until we read their very dysfunctional and destructive family story. They lie, cheat, nearly kill each other, not to mention the sex scandals. But, what did you expect after the garden story? They are human. Eventually, Abraham's family ends up exiled down in Egypt. All these failures of Abraham's family form a dark background for the handful of bright moments in the story. God stays committed to these people. He even makes them an eternal promise called a \"covenant\" that he will rescue and bless all humanity through them. How exactly is not clear. But Abraham's family is at its best when they stop their selfish scheming and trust God's promise with radical faith. From here, the family grows. They end up enslaved in Egypt.

Moses brokers this whole deal because he is awesome. He is the ultimate prophet who speaks God's word to Israel. He is a priest who represents them before God and he is even called a king, Israel's leader and deliverer in time of need. But as the Torah progresses, the Israelites fail, big time. They violate the covenant and even Moses rebels against God. In fact, the Torah ends with Moses predicting that Israel's failure will continue as they go back into the Promised Land. And they are going to end up in exile once again. But, he has hope that God will fulfill his promise to rescue Israel. One day he will cover for their failures, he will heal their selfish hearts so they can truly love God and live. And then, Moses dies. The final sentences of the Torah scroll are surprising.",

They tell us that never again in Israel's history did a prophet like Moses arise. Man, I wish another prophet-priest-king like him would come along. With that, we move into the Nevi'im. It has two sub-collections. First, the former prophets. Four narrative works about Israel's story in the Promised Land, told from the later perspective of the prophet. Things start great with Joshua's leadership. We are told he is successful because he is just like Moses. And, he meditates on Scripture day and night. But, eventually, even Joshua fails beginning Israel's long and violent descent into self destruction, just like Moses and the garden story anticipated. These stories mostly focus on the failure of Israel's kings, prophets and priests, how they lie, cheat, kill each other and worship idols. It is basically a longer, bloodier replay of the ancestors' failures. But there are some bright spots. God reaffirms his covenant promise to bless humanity through a new human.

They know exile is not the end. So they design these stories of Israel's past as pointers to their future hope. When God does rescue his people out of Babylon, he will send that new king who will be like Moses and David and Solomon were on their good days. In fact, this is what the second part of the Nevi'im, the latter prophet, is all about. There are 3 large and 12 short works connected to specific prophets.

They will live in a new covenant relationship with God under the reign of that promised ruler who is described as a new Moses but called by the name, David. He will be the one to restore God's blessing to the entire world. The conclusion of the Nevi'im is just like the Torah. There is a note from the TaNaK's prophetic scribes. They reflect back over the whole story so far. They urge readers to anticipate the arrival of a new Moses-like prophet who they call \"Elijah\". He will announce the arrival of Israel's God to purify and save his people. From here, we move into the TaNaKh's third and final sub-collection, the Ketuvim, a diverse collection of scrolls.",

In the first Psalm, we meet the Righteous One who is described as a new Joshua, a successful leader who meditates on the Scriptures. He is like the king promised by Moses. And he is like the eternal tree of life in the Garden of Eden. Psalm 2 then identifies this figure: it is the promised king, the son of God from the line of David who is going to defeat evil among the nations and restore God's blessing to the world. The rest of the Psalms scroll teaches God's people how to pray as they wait for this future hope. Then there are the wisdom scrolls that address some of the most difficult questions raised by the story of the Torah and the Prophets. So Proverbs sounds like Moses in the Torah: trust in God, be faithful and obedient, and you will have peace and success.",

The Daniel scroll looks back over the long history of Israel's failure and suffering as a strange door of hope into a new future for the world. One day, that new human promised in the Torah and the Prophets will arrive. He is going to be trampled by humanity's animal-like inclinations towards evil. But then God will vindicate him and raise him up to rule the world in divine power. Finally, the scroll of Chronicles retells the entire story of the TaNaKh, from the beginning up to Israel's return from exile.

And these two parts are connected by a hinge story at the beginning of chapter 12. And this design, it gives us a clue as to how to understand the message of the book as a whole and how it introduces the story of the whole Bible. So the book begins with God taking the disorder and the darkness described in the second sentence of the Bible and God brings out of it order and beauty and goodness and he makes out of it a world where life can flourish. And God makes these creatures called humans or \"adam,\" in Hebrew. He makes them in his image, which has to do with their role and purpose in God's world.

Now the key is that the humans have a choice about how they're going to go about building this world and that's represented by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Up till now, God has provided and defined what is good and what is not good. But now God is giving humans the dignity and the freedom of a choice: Are they going to trust God's definition of good and evil or are they going to seize autonomy and define good and evil for themselves? And the stakes are really high. To rebel against God is to embrace death because you're turning away from the giver of life himself. This is represented by the Tree of Life.

It says that seizing the knowledge of good and evil are not going to bring death and that it's actually the way to life and becoming like God themselves. Now the irony of this is tragic because we know the humans are already like God--they were made to reflect God's image. But instead of trusting God, the humans seize autonomy, they take the knowledge of good and evil for themselves, and in an instant the whole story spirals out of control. The first casualty is human relationships. The man and the woman they suddenly realize how vulnerable they are. Now they can't even trust each other. And so they make clothes and they hide their bodies from one another. The second casualty is that intimacy between God and humans is lost. So they go, run, and hide from God.",

God promises that one day a seed, or a descendant, will come from the woman, who's going to deliver a lethal strike to the snakes head. Which sounds like great news, but this victory is going to come with a cost because the snake, too, will deliver a lethal strike to the descendant's heal as it's being crushed. It's a very mysterious promise of this wounded victor. But in the flow of the story so far, you see that this is an act of God's grace. The humans, they've just rebelled. And what does God do?

So there's the story of two brothers, Cain and Abel. Cain is so jealous of his brother that he wants to murder him. And God warns him not to give in to the temptation but he does anyway. He murders him in the field. So Cain then goes on to build a city where violence and oppression reign. And this is all epitomized in this story of Lamech. He's the first man in the Bible to have more than one wife. He's accumulating them like property.

Whichever view is right, the point is that humans are building kingdoms that fill God's world with violence and even more corruption. In response, we are told that God is broken with grief, humanity is ruining his good world and they're ruining each other. And so out of a passion to protect the goodness of his world, he washes it clean of humanity's evil with a great flood. But he protects one blameless human--Noah, and his family.

The humans choose sin and rebellion and so the world spins out of\ncontrol into violence and death all leading up to the rebellion and\nscattering of the people in Babylon. And so the big question is what is God going to do to rescue and redeem his world? Well out of that scattering at Babylon, the author traces the genealogy of just one family that leads eventually to a man\nnamed Abram, later known as Abraham. And God's promise to Abraham at the\nbeginning of chapter 12 opens up a whole new movement in the story. God calls\nAbraham to leave his home and go to the land of Canaan which God says will\nbecome his one day. And in that land, God promises to make Abraham into a great nation, to make his name great and bless him. Now these promises are connected\nback to earlier parts of the book.",

So the question is: \"Why is God going to blessed Abraham and his family?\" And the last line of God's promise makes this clear: \"So that all the families of the earth will find God's blessing in you.\" Now this is key for\nunderstanding the whole rest of the biblical story.

This is also why Israel will later be called a kingdom of priests at\nMount Sinai.",

Now at this point of the story, none of that is clear. You just have to keep\nreading and watch the promise develop. And so the rest of the book focuses on Abraham and his family. First Abraham himself, then his son Isaac and then his son Jacob and then Jacob's twelve sons. And the stories about each generation, \nthey're united by two main themes. So first, each generation of Abraham's\nfamily is marked by repeated failure. They just keep making really bad\ndecisions that mess up their lives and put God's promise in jeopardy. However God remains faithful to them. He keeps rescuing them from themselves and reaffirming his commitment to bless them and bless the nations through them despite their failings.",

And not only that, Abraham and his wife Sarah they can't have children\nand so Sarah arranges for Abraham to sleep with one of their servant girls,\nwhich also creates all of these problems in the family. But each time God bales\nAbraham out and in chapters 15 and 17 God even formalizes his promise to Abraham with an official commitment called a covenant. This is a classic scene. God invites Abraham to look up at the night stars and to count them and he says that's how numerous your family's going to be. And despite all of the odds - having no\nkids and no way to have any at the moment, Abraham looks up in the sky and simply trusts God's promise.",

This is a symbol to remind them that the fruitfulness of their family is\na gift from God. And so Abraham has lots of kids eventually and he dies at a good old age. Now the Jacob stories play out these\nthemes even more dramatically. From birth, Jacob lives up to the meaning of his\nname, which is \"deceiver\". He cheats his brother Esau out of his inheritance and blessing and he does it by deceiving his old blind father no less, and then he\njust takes off.

Jacob loves his second to youngest son Joseph more than any of the others and he gives him a special jacket. And the 10 older sons come to\nhate Joseph and so they kidnap him and they plan to kill him, but instead they\ndecide to just sell him into slavery in Egypt where he ends up in prison.

He says to his brother's, \"You planned this for evil but God planned it\nfor good, to save many lives.\" Now these words are strategically placed at the end of\nthe book because they summarize not only the story of Joseph and his brothers, but the book as a whole.

It's super important to read this section of the story really closely in its sequence. In Moses and Pharaoh's first encounter we're told simply that Pharaoh's heart\ngrew hard.

But eventually Pharaoh's evil reaches a point\nof no return-- I mean even his own advisers think that he has lost his mind.

Two of these were ways that, in Israel, I could say \"thank you\" to God by\noffering back to God the symbolic tokens of what God has first forgiven them. Three other sacrifices were different ways of saying sorry to God. So here in Israel, I\nwould offer up the lifeblood of an animal while confessing that their sin\nhas created more evil and death in God's good world. But instead of destroying\nthis person, God of course wants to forgive them. And so this animal\nsymbolically dies in their place and atones, which means it covers for their sin. And so through these rituals the Israelites were constantly being\nreminded of God's grace but also of his justice and the seriousness of their\nevil and its consequences. The second set of rituals lays out the seven annual\nfeasts of Israel. And each of these retold a different part of the story about how\nGod redeemed them from slavery in Egypt and brought them through the wilderness\non their way to the promised land.",

Back here in this first section,\nright after the family of Aaron was ordained, two of his sons waltz right\ninto God's presence and flagrantly violate the rules. And so they are\nconsumed by God's holiness on the spot. It's a haunting reminder of the paradox\nof living in God's holy presence because it's pure goodness, but it becomes\ndangerous to those who rebell and insult God's holiness. And so it's\nimportant that Israel's priests become holy and also that all of the people\nof Israel become holy, which is what the next\nintersections are all about.",

When they enter into his presence, this was called being clean or pure. God's\npresence was off limits to anybody who was not in a holy state. And this was\ncalled being unclean or impure. Now in Israel I could become impure in just a\nfew ways: by contact with reproductive body fluids, by having a skin disease, by\ntouching mold or fungus, or by touching a dead body. Now for the Israelites, all of\nthese were associated with mortality, with the loss of life. Which gets us to\nthe core symbol of all these ideas. You become impure when you're contaminated by touching death, so to speak. And death is the opposite of God's holiness\nbecause God 's essence is life. Now this is really key: simply being impure was not\nsinful or wrong.",

To promote hygiene or to avoid cultural taboos--the text just isn't explicit. But the basic point\nof all of these chapters is really clear. Altogether these work as an elaborate\nset of cultural symbols that remind Israel that God's holiness was to effect all\nareas of their lives. This corresponding section over here is\nabout Israel's moral purity. The Israelites were called to live\ndifferently than the Canaanites. They were to care for the poor\ninstead of overlooking them. They were to have a high level of sexual integrity,\nand they were to promote justice throughout their entire land.",

After this comes a series of very passionate sermons where Moses calls on this new generation to be more faithful than their parents were to the Covenant. He reminds them of the Ten Commandments and then the centerpiece of the section is the famous line called the Shema. Moses says \u201cListen Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord alone, and you shall love the Lord your God with all of your heart, with all of your soul, and with all of your might.\u201d This became a very important daily prayer in Judaism and it brings all of the themes of the book together.

They'll become a kingdom of priests, and Moses now says how. Israel has the chance by following the laws to show the whole world the wisdom and the justice of God. The other key idea in the shema is that Israel was called to obey and be devoted to the Lord alone, or literally in Hebrew it says \u201cthe Lord is one\u201d. In context the point is that the Lord is the one God Israel is to worship and obey.

So for example, all Israelites were to set aside one tenth of their annual income to be given to the temple, but another tenth was to be set aside every three years and given to the poor.

And so finally try to discern what core principles of wisdom or justice underlie any particular law, and you\u2019ll discover some really profound things. So here's an extra credit assignment: go see how Paul the Apostle does this very thing in his first letter to the Corinthians, chapter 9 vs nine, and he quotes a law from Deuteronomy, chapter 25 verse four, It\u2019s really interesting. So back to Moses - after he goes through all of the laws, he issues a final challenge that Israel should listen to and love their God. He first issues a warning and the ultimatum: if Israel listens to and obeys their God everything's gonna go great- lots of divine blessing, but if they don't listen and rebel\u2026famine, plague, devastation, and ultimately exile from the land.",

And how is God going to transform the hearts of his people? You just have to keep reading to find out.",

So through Moses, God rescued Israel out of Egypt, he made a covenant with them at Mount Sinai and he brought them through the wilderness. So Israel then camped outside the promised land and Moses called them to obey God\u2019s commands so that they could show all the other nations what God is like. The book of Joshua picks up right after Moses has died and Israel is ready to enter the land. So the story of Joshua is designed with four main movements. Joshua first leads Israel into the promised land, and then once they are there, they meet all this hostility from the Canaanites and so they engage them in battle, then after their victory Joshua divides up the promised land as the inheritance for the twelve tribes and then the book concludes with these final speeches that Joshua gives to the people. So let\u2019s dive in and we will see how all of it flows together.",

In fact, some Canaanites turn and follow the God of Israel, Joshua then leads all Israel across the Jordan river and into the land. Just like the sea parted for Moses in the Exodus so here the river Jordan parts and the priests carry the Ark of the Covenant across leading all Israel with them. Now, in chapter 5 the story transitions, so the people look back to their roots as God\u2019s covenant people and so the new generation is circumcised and they celebrate their first Passover in the land. But then, they turn prepared to go forward and Joshua has this crazy encounter with a mysterious warrior, who, it turns out is the angelic commander of God\u2019s army, and Joshua asks, \u201cAre you for us?",

It makes clear that this whole story is not about Israel versus the Canaanites, rather this is God\u2019s battle, and Israel is going to play the role of spectators or sometimes supporters in God\u2019s plan. Which leads to the next section. We find stories about all these conflicts that Israel has with different Canaanite groups, and the first part retells the story of two battles in detail and that is followed by a series of short stories that condense years of battles into a few brief summaries. So the first two battles are against Jericho and then Ai, and they offer these contrasting portraits of God\u2019s faithfulness versus Israel\u2019s failure.",

The point of the story is that God is the one who will deliver his people; Israel simply needs to trust and wait. Now the next story, of the battle of Ai makes the opposite point. So there is this Israelite named Achan, and he steals from Jericho some of the devoted goods that were to belong to God alone and then he lies about it. It\u2019s a pretty lame move after all that God has done for Israel, and so Israel goes into battle with the city of Ai and they are totally defeated, and it\u2019s only after humble repentance and severely dealing with Achan\u2019s sin that Israel gains victory. And so together these two stories are placed right up front to make an important point.",

This is in contrast to all these other Canaanite kings who start to form alliances and coalitions and they want to destroy Israel. So Israel engages them in battle and they win by a land slide. So this whole section concludes with this summary list of all of these victories won by Moses and then by Joshua. Now, let\u2019s stop for a second because odds are that these stories and the violence in them, they are going to bother you, and if you are a follower of Jesus, you\u2019re bound to wonder, like, didn\u2019t Jesus said to love your enemies? Why is God declaring war here? So first, why the Canaanites?",

Which raises the second question. Did God actually command the destruction of all the Canaanites, like a genocide? So at first glance, you know, you look at the phrases used in these stories. They \u201ctotally destroyed them\u201d, they \u201cleft no survivor or anything that breathed\u201d, but when you look a second time more closely, you\u2019ll see that these phrases are clearly hyperbole and not literal. So go back to the original command about the Canaanites in Deuteronomy chapter 7. Israel is first told to drive out the Canaanites, but then to totally destroy them and then that is followed by commands to not intermarry with them or enter into business deals with them. So you can\u2019t marry someone that you\u2019ve destroyed. I think you get the point. The same idea applies to the stories in Joshua, look closely.",

And so the word genocide doesn\u2019t actually fit what we see here. Especially in light of the stories about the Canaanites who did turn to the God of Israel, like Rahab or the Gibeonites, God was open to those who would turn to him. The last thing to think about is that these stories mark a unique moment in Israel\u2019s history. These battles were limited to the handful of people groups living in the land of Canaan. With all other nations, Israel was commanded by God to pursue peace, go read Deuteronomy chapter 20. So the purpose of these battle stories was never to tell you, the reader, to go commit violence in God\u2019s name.",

After years of battles we see an aging Joshua and he starts dividing up the land for the twelve tribes of Israel, and most of this section is like lists of boundary lines, and let us be honest, it\u2019s kind of boring. It\u2019s like reading a map that has no pictures. But for the Israelites these lists were super important. This was the fulfillment of God\u2019s ancient promises to Abraham that his descendants would inherit the promised land. . And so now it was all coming to pass right down to the detail, which leads to the final section. Joshua gives two speeches to the people they\u2019re very similar to the final speeches of Moses in Deuteronomy. Joshua reminds them of God\u2019s generosity, how he brought them into the land and rescued them from the Canaanites. And so, he calls them to turn away from the Canaanite gods and be faithful to the covenant they made.",

This tragic story it shows just how far Israel has fallen, they no longer know the character of their own God, which leads to murder and to false worship. The last judge Samson is by far the worst. his life began full of promise, but he has no regard for the God of Israel. He was promiscuous, violent and arrogant. He did win brutally strategic victories over the Philistines but only at the expense of his own integrity and his life ends in a violent rush of mass murder. Now a quick note here, you\u00b4ll notice a repeated theme in the main section of the book that at key moments God\u00b4s Spirit will empower each of these judges to accomplish these great acts of deliverance. Now the fact that God uses these really screwed up people doesn\u00b4t mean he endorses all or even any of their decisions.",

The final section shows Israel as a whole hitting bottom. There are two tragic stories here and they are not for the faint of heart. They\u00b4re structured by this key line that gets repeated four times at the close of the book In those days Israel had no king and everyone did what was right in their own eyes. The first story is about an Israelite named Micah who built a private temple to an idol. And that gets plundered by a private army sent by the tribe of Dan. So they come and they steal everything and then they go and burn down the peaceful city of Laish and murder all of its inhabitants, its a horrifying story.

The only glimmer of hope in this story is found in this repeated line in the last part of the book. It actually forms the last sentence of this story. Israel has no king and so the stage is set for the following books to tell the origins of King David\u00b4s family, the book of Ruth, and also the origins of kingship itself in Israel, the book of 1 Samuel. But the story of Judges has value as a tragedy - it's a sobering explanation of  the human condition, and ultimately it points out the need for God\u00b4s grace to send a king who will rescue His people.

Check out the video on First Samuel where we were introduced to the book's three main characters:\nSamuel, Saul and David and then also to the book's literary design\nwhich first introduced Samuel and then traced the rise and fall of king Saul in\ncontrast to the rise of king David. 2nd Samuel tells the story of David\nas Israel's King and in two movements; there's a season of success and a blessing, followed by a huge moral failure and then sad consequences. And then the book ends with this well-crafted conclusion that reflects back on the good and the bad in David's life, generating hope for a future king to come from his line. So 2nd Samuel picks up after Saul's death and David surprises everyone by composing this long poem where he laments the death of\nthe very man who tried to murder him. And so once again the author is presenting David's humility and compassion; he's a man who grieves the death even of his own enemies. After this, David experiences a season of success and God's blessing.",

The next inner pair of stories are about David and his band of mighty men, who went about fighting the\nPhilistines and what's interesting is that both sections have a story of\nDavid's weakness in battle, so in contrast to the victorious David of chapters 1 through 9, here we see a vulnerable David, who is dependent on others for help.

                "text": "The book of first and second kings Although they are two separate books in our Bibles They were originally written as one book telling a unified story that continues on from the book of Samuel that came before it So David has unified the tribes of Israel into a kingdom and God promised that from his line would come a Messianic king who would establish God's kingdom over the nation's and fulfill the promises made to Abraham So the Book of Kings tells the story of the long line of Kings that came after David and none of them lived up to that promise In fact, they run the nation of Israel right into the ground The book is designed to have five main movements the story begins and ends focus on Jerusalem First with Solomon's reign in the construction of the temple and then in this last section ending with jerusalem's destruction and Israel's exile to Babylon and the story leading up to this tragedy is what makes up the center three sections which explain how Israel split into two rival kingdoms how God tried to prevent the corruption\nof Israel by sending the prophets and how exile became unavoidable consequence of Israel's sins The book opens with two chapters about the kingdom passing from the aging David to his son Solomon and David's final words to Solomon they're very similar to those of Moses and Joshua and Samuel to the people It's a call to remain faithful to the commands of the covenants and to give allegiance to the God of Israel alone but David's words bring somewhat hollow here because David and Solomon then go on to conspire how they're going to consolidate this new kingdom through a whole series of political assassinations so it's not off to a great start Solomon's brightest moment comes when he asked God for wisdom to lead Israel and he even complete David's dream to make a temple for the God of Israel Here the story actually stops and describes the design of this temple in detail just like the tabernacle design in the Torah there's all these gold and jewels and depictions of angels and fruit trees It's all symbolism echoing back to the garden of eden it's the place where heaven and earth meet where God's presence dwells with his people but no sooner does Solomon finish the temple but he makes them really horrible choices and the Kingdom falls apart he starts marrying the daughters of other kings hundreds of them for political alliances and then he adopts their gods and introduces the worship of those gods into Israel Solomon then accumulates huge amounts of wealth he built a huge army He even Institute slave labor for all of his building projects Now if you go back to the Torah and look at God's guidelines for Israel's kings in Deuteronomy 17 Solomon is breaking every one so by the time that he dies Solomon resembles Pharaoh the king of Egypt more than he does his father David the next section of the book opens with Solomon's son, Rehoboam, acting just like his father it's a very sad story of greed and lust for power he tries to increase taxes for slave labor and under the leadership of Jeroboam the northern tribes reject this they rebelled and secede and form their own rival Kingdom and so now in the story you have the southern kingdom of Judah centered in Jerusalem with Kings from the line of David and now this new northern kingdom called Israel who's capital will be Samaria eventually Jeroboam also goes on to build two new temples to compete with Solomon's temple in the south he put the Golden Calf in each one to\nrepresent the God of Israel The connection to Exodus 32 and the Golden Calf\nIt's all quite explicit From this point on the story goes back and forth from north to south tracing the fate of both kingdoms Each one had about 20 successive kings and as the author introduces each king he evaluates their reign by a few criteria did they worship the God of Israel alone or did they promote the worship other gods did they deal with idolatry among the people and did they remained faithful to the Covenant like David or do they become corrupt and unjust and according to these criteria the author finds no good kings in northern Israel zero for twenty And then in southern Judah only eight out of 20 get a positive rating which connects to another huge purpose in this book and that to introduce the role of the prophet\nkey figures in israel's history so in the Bible, prophets were not fortune tellers rather they spoke on behalf of the God of Israel and they played the role of Covenant watchdog which means they called out idolatry and injustice among the Kings and the people they were constantly reminding Israel of\ntheir calling to be a light to the nations that they should obey the commands of the Torah and so the prophets challenged Israel to repent and follow their God In these centres sections for each King, God then raises up prophets to hold them accountable the most prominent prophets over the northern ones are Elijah and his disciples Elisha right here in the center of the book Elijah was a wild man of a prophet living out in the desert and his arch nemesis was the northern King Ahab and his Canaanite wife Jezebel together these two had instituted the worship of the Canaanites God Baal over Israel and so in a famous story Elijah challenged four hundred  and fifty prophets of Baal to a contest to see which God was a real so they both built altars and prayed to\ntheir gods but only the God of Israel answers with fire After this, Ahab uses his royal power to murder an Israelite farmer and then steal his family's vineyard and the Elijah again confront Ahab's injustice and he announces the downfall of his house Elijah eventually passes the mantle of\nhis prophetic leadership to a young disciple named Elisha who asks for two times the authority of Elijah but what's fascinating here is how the author is recounted 7 miraculous feats for Elijah and then he offers stories of 14 acts of power from Elisha Both prophets were clearly remarkable men and they played the same role confronting Israel's Kings for idolatry and injustice and ultimately they were unsuccessful in turning Israel back from apostasy In the next section, the northern kingdom has rocked by a bloody revolution started by a king named Jehu who destroys Ahab's family and although Jehu was at first commissioned by God his violence just gets out of control and it creates the spiral of political assassinations and rebellions from which Israel never recovered coup follows coup after Jehu and each King follows other gods allows horrible injustice it all leads up to second Kings chapter 17 the big bad empire of Assyria swoops\ndown and takes out the northern kingdom altogether and the capital city of Samaria is conquered and the Israelites were exiled and scattered throughout the ancient world now chapter 17 is key the author stops the story and offers this prophetic reflection and what's just happened he blames the downfall of the northern kingdom on the idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness of Israel and its kings and so God has allowed them to face the consequences of their decisions The final movement of the book tells the story of the lone southern kingdom In here, we meet very heroic kings like\nHezekiah who trust God when the armies of Assyria come knocking on Jerusalem's door or Josiah who discovers this lost scroll of the Torah in the temple So he start to reading it.",

There's the lofty city that has\nexalted itself above God and become corrupt and unjust. This city is an\narchetype of rebellious humanity and is described with language that's all\nborrowed from Isaiah's earlier descriptions of Jerusalem and Assyria\nand Babylon all put together. This city is destined for ruin and one day is\ngoing to be replaced by the New Jerusalem where God reigns as king over a\nredeemed humanity from all nations and there's no more death or suffering.",

The following section return the focus to\nthe rise and fall of Jerusalem, and first we find a whole bunch of poems where Isaiah\naccuses Jerusalem's leaders for turning to Egypt for military protection against Assyria. He knows this\nwill backfire and Isaiah says that only trust in their God and repentance can\nsave Israel now, which gets illustrated by the following story about the rise of\nHezekiah, king of Jerusalem. Just as Isaiah predicted, the Assyrian armies come and\ntry to attack the city and so Hezekiah humbles himself before God and he\nprays for divine deliverance and the city is miraculously saved overnight, but\nHezekiah's rise is immediately followed by his fall. So he hosts a\ndelegation from Babylon and he tries to impress them by showing everything in\nJerusalem's treasury and temple and palaces, it's clearly an effort to make\nanother political alliance for protection.",

Over a hundred years later\nBabylon would turn on Jerusalem, come and destroy the city, its temple, and carry\nthe Israelites away to exile in Babylon. And so all of Isaiah's warnings of\ndivine judgment in chapters 1 to 39 lead up to this moment. He's shown to be a\ntrue prophet because it all came to pass like he said. But remember the purpose of\nGod's judgment was to purify Jerusalem and bring the holy seed and messianic\nKingdom over all nations, and it's that hope that gets explored in the next part\nof the book, but for now that's what Isaiah chapters 1 to 39 are all about.",

                "text": "the book of the Prophet Jeremiah Jeremiah was\u00a0\nan Israelite priests who lived and worked in\u00a0\u00a0 Jerusalem during the final decades of the kingdom\u00a0\nof southern Judah he was called as a prophet to\u00a0\u00a0 warn Israel about the severe consequences of\u00a0\nbreaking their covenant with God through their\u00a0\u00a0 idolatry and injustice and he even predicted that\u00a0\nthe Empire of Babylon would come as God's servant\u00a0\u00a0 to bring this judgment on Israel by destroying\u00a0\nJerusalem taking the people into exile and sadly\u00a0\u00a0 his words became reality Jeremiah lived through\u00a0\nthe siege and destruction of Jerusalem and\u00a0\u00a0 witnessed the exile personally now this book came\u00a0\ninto existence in a really interesting way chapter\u00a0\u00a0 36 tells us that after 20 years of Jeremiah's\u00a0\npreaching in Jerusalem God called him to collect\u00a0\u00a0 all of his sermons and poems and essays and commit\u00a0\nthem to writing which Jeremiah did by employing\u00a0\u00a0 a scribe named Baruch who wrote down and compiled\u00a0\nall of this material into a scroll now Baruch also\u00a0\u00a0 gathered lots of stories about Jeremiah and he\u00a0\nlinked all the pieces together and so this is why\u00a0\u00a0 the book reads like an anthology a collection of\u00a0\ncollections it's all been arranged to present this\u00a0\u00a0 prophet as a messenger of God's justice and grace\u00a0\nso the book begins with God calling Jeremiah to be\u00a0\u00a0 a prophet and he's given a dual vocation he will\u00a0\nbe a prophet to Israel but also to the nation's\u00a0\u00a0 and his words will both up rout and teardown but\u00a0\nalso plant and build up in other words he's going\u00a0\u00a0 to accuse Israel and warn them of God's coming\u00a0\njudgment but he also has a message of hope for\u00a0\u00a0 the future now this opening perfectly summarizes\u00a0\nthe first large section chapters 1 to 24 it's a\u00a0\u00a0 collection of Jeremiah's writings from before the\u00a0\nExile and the core idea here is that Israel has\u00a0\u00a0 broken the covenant with God and violated all the\u00a0\nterms of the agreement they made that are written\u00a0\u00a0 in the Torah and in a number of ways they've\u00a0\nadopted the worship of all kinds of Canaanite\u00a0\u00a0 gods building idol shrines all over the land\u00a0\nand jeremiah develops the metaphor of idolatry\u00a0\u00a0 as adultery and uses the language of prostitution\u00a0\npromiscuity unfaithfulness to describe how Israel\u00a0\u00a0 has given their allegiance to other gods Jeremiah\u00a0\nalso repeatedly accuses Israel's leaders the\u00a0\u00a0 priests Kings the other prophets have all become\u00a0\ncorrupt they've abandoned the Torah and covenant\u00a0\u00a0 which has led to a tragic result rampant social\u00a0\ninjustice the most vulnerable people in Israelite\u00a0\u00a0 communities the widows orphans and immigrants were\u00a0\nall being taken advantage of in clear violation of\u00a0\u00a0 the laws of the Torah and Israel's leaders didn't\u00a0\neven seem to care so a classic place where all of\u00a0\u00a0 these ideas come together is in Chapter seven it's\u00a0\ncalled Jeremiah's temple sermon the Israelites are\u00a0\u00a0 coming to worship their God in the temple as if\u00a0\neverything is just fine but outside the temple\u00a0\u00a0 they are worshiping other gods and some were\u00a0\neven adopting the horrifying Canaanite practice\u00a0\u00a0 of child sacrifice and so Jeremiah makes his\u00a0\nvery unpopular announcement the God of Israel is\u00a0\u00a0 coming in judgment he's going to destroy his own\u00a0\ntemple and punish Israel by sending an enemy from\u00a0\u00a0 the north this is an army that God would allow to\u00a0\nconquer Jerusalem and as you read on you discover\u00a0\u00a0 he's talking about the great Empire of Babylon and\u00a0\nso this all leads up to a transition in chapter 25\u00a0\u00a0 Israel hasn't turned back to their God and so in\u00a0\nthe first year of babylons new king Nebuchadnezzar\u00a0\u00a0 God tells Jeremiah to announce that the Babylonian\u00a0\narmies are headed for Israel and all of its\u00a0\u00a0 neighbors to conquer them and take them into exile\u00a0\nfor 70 years he compares Babylon to a cup of wine\u00a0\u00a0 filled to the brim with God's just anger at all of\u00a0\nIsrael's injustice and idolatry and God will make\u00a0\u00a0 Israel and the nation's drink from this Cup now\u00a0\nthis chapter is key to the books design because\u00a0\u00a0 everything that follows is going to focus on\u00a0\nbabylons coming attack first on Israel in chapters\u00a0\u00a0 26 to 45 and then on the other nations in chapters\u00a0\n46 to 51 the section about Israel first contains\u00a0\u00a0 stories about how Jeremiah begged Israel to turn\u00a0\nback how he warned them right up to the last\u00a0\u00a0 minute but the leaders of Israel kept rejecting\u00a0\nhim the section concludes with a large collection\u00a0\u00a0 of stories about how Jerusalem was under siege\u00a0\nand eventually destroyed by Babylon and about how\u00a0\u00a0 Jeremiah was persecuted all through that time and\u00a0\neventually kidnapped and taken against his will to\u00a0\u00a0 Egypt by a group of Israelite rebels now right\u00a0\nhere in the middle in between all of these dark\u00a0\u00a0 stories of disaster and judgment is a collection\u00a0\nof Jeremiah's messages of hope for Israel's future\u00a0\u00a0 so he picks up on Moses diction that after Israel\u00a0\nhad broken the Covenant and gone into exile see\u00a0\u00a0 Deuteronomy 30 God would not abandon his people\u00a0\nrather he would renew his covenant with them and\u00a0\u00a0 transform their hearts jeremiah develops this\u00a0\npromise and he says that god is going to one day\u00a0\u00a0 inscribe the laws of the Torah not on tablets but\u00a0\nrather on the hearts of his own people he's going\u00a0\u00a0 to heal their rebellion so that they can truly\u00a0\none day love and follow him fully and so one\u00a0\u00a0 day Israel will return back to the land and the\u00a0\nMessiah from the line of David is going to come\u00a0\u00a0 and that's when all nations will come to recognize\u00a0\nIsrael's God as the true God so these chapters are\u00a0\u00a0 showing that despite Israel's apostasy God is\u00a0\nnot going to let Israel sin get the final word\u00a0\u00a0 rather his own faithfulness will bring about the\u00a0\nfulfillment of his promises no matter what after\u00a0\u00a0 this we find a large collection of poems about how\u00a0\nGod is going to use Babylon to judge the nations\u00a0\u00a0 around Israel so Egypt Philistia Moab Edom Amman\u00a0\nDamascus Hazor but then surprisingly the longest\u00a0\u00a0 poems are saved for last and they're about God's\u00a0\ncoming judgment on Babylon itself so although God\u00a0\u00a0 used this nation to execute as justice God doesn't\u00a0\nendorse their violence in idolatry and so Babylon\u00a0\u00a0 2 will come under the standard of God's justice\u00a0\nand so Jeremiah denounces this nation's pride\u00a0\u00a0 and injustice as well now Babylon is larger than\u00a0\nlife in these poems and it reminds us of the image\u00a0\u00a0 of Babylon all the way back from Genesis chapter\u00a0\n11 Babylon has become the archetypal rebellious\u00a0\u00a0 nation in their glorification of wealth and war\u00a0\nGod's going to give this nation over to its own\u00a0\u00a0 destruction the book concludes with a story taken\u00a0\nfrom the end of the book of second Kings it tells\u00a0\u00a0 about babylons final attack on Jerusalem how\u00a0\nthey destroyed the city walls and burn the\u00a0\u00a0 temple and took the people into exile the story\u00a0\nshows how Jeremiah's warnings of judgment from\u00a0\u00a0 chapters 1 through 24 were fulfilled but then the\u00a0\nchapter ends with a short story about the captive\u00a0\u00a0 Israelite king Jochen he's heir to the line of\u00a0\nDavid and the king of Babylon releases him from\u00a0\u00a0 prison and shows him favor and invites him to eat\u00a0\nat the Royal table for the of his life and that's\u00a0\u00a0 how the book ends so it's a little glimmer of\u00a0\nhope and this recalls Jeremiah's promises of\u00a0\u00a0 hope from chapters 32 33 God hasn't abandoned his\u00a0\npeople or the promise of a future coming king from\u00a0\u00a0 David's line and so while this book contains a\u00a0\nhuge amount of warning and judgment the final\u00a0\u00a0 words conclude with a note of hope for the future\u00a0\nand that's what the Book of Jeremiah is all about",

And Ezekiel was sitting on the bank of an irrigation canal near his Israelite refugee camp. And it's his 30th birthday, no less-- the year that he would have been installed as a priest in Jerusalem. And then all of a sudden Ezekiel has this vision. He sees a storm cloud approaching. And then inside the cloud are four strange creatures that have wings outstretched and touching each other. And these creatures each had each four faces. And then he saw four wheels-- one by each creature. And then he saw that the wings of the creatures were supporting this dazzling platform.

Now the word \"glory.\" In Hebrew it's \"kavod.\" It means \"heavy\" or \"significant.\" The biblical authors use this word to describe the physical appearance and manifestation of God's significance when He shows up in person. These images in the vision, they're very similar to what happened when God appeared on Mount Sinai on the book of Exodus. And is also very similar to the depictions of God's presence over the Ark of the Covenant. And that's actually the most shocking thing about Ezekiel's vision, \"What is God's glory doing in Babylon?\" It's supposed to be above the Ark of the Covenant in the temple in Jerusalem. And so the first section of the book opens to explore that question as Ezekiel begins to accuse Israel of rebellion. So God first speaks to Ezekiel from the throne chariot and He commissions him as a prophet. Ezekiel is to accuse Israel of breaking their covenant agreement with God in a couple of ways.",

Ezekiel would go out on public and start behaving in this really bizarre ways that were like parables of his prophetic message. So he was supposed to build a tiny model of Jerusalem and then staged an attack of it. Or he was to shave off all of his hair and then chop it up with a sword.

And Ezekiel had the unfortunate privilege of seeing it all come to pass. And so a dismayed Ezekiel, he begins to perform his task. And after about a year he has another vision. This one is about the temple. He goes on this virtual tour of the temple and he sees what's happening there in his absence. And it is not good. In the outer courtyard, in front of the temple, he sees this large idol statue. And then he sees the elders of Israel\nworshiping other gods, both outside and inside the temple. And then he sees the women of Israel, they're worshiping a Babylonian god named Tammuz. And the vision ends with God's glorious throne chariot moving up and away from the temple.

It's become so blatant and offensive that God has left His temple. They've driven Him away and He consigns it to destruction. But God hasn't abandoned His people. Rather He goes into exile with them. And so at the end of this vision in chapter 11, God promises that He will return a remnant of Israel back to the land. And He'll transform them by removing their heart of stone and giving them a new soft heart of flesh. So that they can love and truly follow their God after all. This is a small glimmer of hope. And it's quickly submerged under the reality of the imminent destruction. But chapter 11, it's a key transition. And it helps us understand how the rest of the book has been designed.

So he depicts Israel as a burnt useless stick, or as a rebellious wife, or as a dangerous raging lion that gets captured, or as two promiscuous sisters. These are all depictions of Israel's senseless rebellion and idolatry that results in their ruin. In this section, Ezekiel also acts like a lawyer. He begins arguing to the case. That first of all, Jerusalem's destruction is truly deserved after centuries of covenant violation. And that even if the most righteous people in the world like Noah, or Daniel, or Job were alive and praying for God to spare Israel God would not accept their prayers. It's far too late.

And God holds these kings accountable for their pride and he announces that He will use Babylon to bring them down They will face God's justice along with everybody else. Following these really intense sections is a short story in chapter 33. Ezekiel's met by a refugee who's just arrived from Jerusalem and he gives him the report. The Babylon has attacked the city of Jerusalem. That the city has fallen and the temple was destroyed. Ezekiel's grim warnings have become a reality. But remember the end of chapter 11, that's not the end of the story. And so on the next video, we'll explore Ezekiel's profound vision of hope.

And this idea gets developed in the next strange vision. Ezekiel sees a huge valley filled up with dry human bones and skeletons. And God tells him that it's an image, a metaphor for Israel's spiritual state. So their rebellion against God that resulted in exile \nand the literal death of many people. But it was also a metaphorical death \nof their covenant relationship. And God tells Ezekiel that His Spirit is coming to bring His people back to life.",

And so the only hope is that God would\nperform a new act of creation and remake humans in such a way that they can truly live in a relationship of love with God and with each other. And so after God is going to deal with the evil that's in the hearts of his own people, some questions still remain unresolved.

And so Ezekiel picks up this\nancient biblical name as an image of any and all violent kingdoms. And so we find that Gog gets allied with seven nations that come from all four directions of\nthe compass. It's clearly an image that represents all of the nations. This also helps us understand why\nEzekiel describes Gog with images that he used earlier in the book to describe the king of Tyre and the king of Egypt, Pharaoh. For Ezekiel Gog is an amalgam of\nall of the worst most violent people in the Bible. Gog is the archetype of human\nrebellion against God. The basic story in these chapters is that Gog resists God's plan to restore His people. And so just like Pharaoh in the Exodus story, Gog comes to destroy the people.

It's clear that these scenes are full of symbol and imagery. Ezekiel has pulled out his entire poetic\n\"tool set\" here to describe how God is determined to finally defeat human evil that has ruined his world. And it's so that he can pave the way for a new creation. And so once evil is finally dealt with among the nations, the last section of the book describes how God's presence is going to one day return to His people and His temple to bring cosmic restoration.

And that these chapters offer the actual blueprints of the new temple that will be built when the Messiah returns and brings God's kingdom. But many other Jewish and Christian readers think \nthat this vision, like all of Ezekiel's other visions, is full of symbols. They depict the reality of God's presence\nreturning to His people in the Messianic Kingdom but not necessarily in the form of an actual building. Whichever view you take, it's important\nthat Ezekiel never calls the city, \"Jerusalem.\" And chapters 47 and 48 show why.

The nation was\ndescending into chaos, and in the year 722 the big bad Assyrian empire swooped\nin, and decimated Israel.

Lets just dive in you'll see how it works. The opening part tells the story of Hosea\u00b4s broken marriage to a woman named\nGomer, who commits adultery. Now it's not totally clear whether Gomer slept around\nwith other men before or only after they got married, but they did have three\nchildren together and things fell apart.",

So God has\nbeen like a faithful husband to Israel, He rescued them out of slavery, He brought\nthem to Mount Sinai where He entered into a covenant with them. He asked them\nto be faithful to Him alone, but then He brought Israel into the promised land\nand they took all the abundance that He gave them and they dedicated it to the\nworship of the Canaanite god Baal, and so God has a legitimate reason. He could end the covenant and divorce Israel and He thinks about doing so but\ninstead, He says that He's going to pursue Israel again and renew His\ncovenant with them. And He says why. It's purely because of His own love,\ncompassion and faithfulness. Hosea  then spells out what all this means.",

And so this\nopening section introduces all the main ideas of the book. Israel has rebelled and God's going to\nbring severe consequences but, God's own covenant love and mercy are more\npowerful than Israel's sin. And so in the remaining sections of the book Hosea\u00b4s poetry explores these themes in more depth. So there are two collections of his\naccusations and warnings for Israel and then each of these is concluded by a\nvery hopeful poem about God's mercy and hope for the future. So chapters 4 through 10, Hosea\nexplores the causes and effects of Israel's unfaithfulness. He says numerous\ntimes that Israel lacks all knowledge or understanding of God.",

He wants them to experience His love for them and\nbecome the kind of knowledge that transforms their hearts and lives so\nthat they love Him in return. And so this is why Hosea is constantly exposing the\nhypocrisy of Israel's worship. He constantly shows how they're breaking\nthe Ten Commandments, how they're allowing grave injustice in their\ncommunities and then they go to their sacred temples and they offer sacrifices\nto God like everything is just fine. But it's not fine and not only because of their hypocrisy but because they're worshiping all of these other gods too.

First of all, there's no explicit\nindication of when this book was written. It's most likely the period of Ezra-\nNehemiah after the return from the exile because he mentions Jerusalem and the\ntemple but there doesn't seem to be any Kings. Also unique is that Joel is\nclearly familiar with many other scriptural books; he alludes to or quotes\nfrom the prophets Isaiah, Amos, Zephaniah, Nahum, Obadiah, Ezekiel, Malachi, even the\nbook of Exodus, and this is connected with the last unique feature and that's\nthat Joel never accuses Israel of any specific sin. So like many of the other\nprophets he announces that God's judgment is coming to confront Israel's\nsin but he never says why and that's most likely because Joel assumes that\nlike him you have been reading the books of the prophets and so you already know\nall about Israel's rebellion.",

Let's dive in and we'll see how this book works. In chapters 1 and 2\nJoel focuses on the day of the LORD. This is a key theme in the prophets and\nit describes events in the past when God appeared in a powerful way to save His\npeople or confront evil, think about the plagues in the book of Exodus. But\nthe prophets saw in these past events pointers to a future time when God would\nagain confront evil among his people but also among the nations and bring\nsalvation to the whole world. And so here, in chapters 1 and 2, Joel has brought two\nparallel poems together that focus on this theme, so chapter one is about a past day\nof the Lord.",

Chapter 2 comes alongside and\nit has the same poetic design and flow of thought; so Joel announces another day\nof the Lord except this time it's future not past. It's an imminent disaster\ncoming on Jerusalem. And he begins describing what seems like another wave\nof locusts but he uses military and cosmic imagery so the locusts become\nGod's army, like cavalry and soldiers that are marching and destroying\neverything in their path. And the Sun has darkened and the earth quakes and Joel says\n\"The day of the Lord is dreadful; who can endure it?\" And so once more Joel\ncalls on the people to pray and repent.",

And here Joel is drawing upon the promises of\nIsaiah, and Jeremiah and Ezekiel that God's Spirit would come to transform and\nempower His people so that they can truly love and follow Him. Joel then picks\nup God's promise that He'll confront the threatening invader. And Joel sees in these\nravaging locusts a similarity to the arrogant violent nations of his own day\nthat ravaged and oppressed people. And so he draws upon the promises of Isaiah, and Zephaniah and Ezekiel about the future day of the Lord when God will confront\nevil among all the nations and turn their violence back on themselves bringing justice to right all wrongs.",

And so Joel's\npoem ends with God's forgiveness and mercy opening up a whole new creation. And so this little book of Joel, it explores profound ideas about how human sin and failure wreak such devastating\ndestruction in our world, about how God longs to show mercy to those who will\njust own up to their sin and confess it, and about how all of that leads us to\nhope that God will one day defeat evil in our world but also inside of us and\nbring His healing presence to make all things new.

Now, the North had seized its independence about a hundred and fifty years earlier, (remember 1 Kings 12) and it was currently being ruled by Jeroboam the Second, a successful military leader. He won lots of battles and new territories for Israel, and he generated lots of wealth. But! In the eyes of the prophets, he was one of the worst kings ever. His wealth had led to apathy, and he allowed idol worship for the gods of Canaan, which in turn led to injustice and the neglect of the poor. And it got to the point where Amos couldn't take it anymore. He sensed God calling him to go, trek up north to Bethel, an important city that had a large temple, and start announcing God's Word to the people. And this book is a collection of his sermons, and poems, and visions uttered over the years.",

Let's just dive in. So the book opens with a series of short poems, that accuse all of Israel's neighbors of violence and injustice. And this is kind of odd, because the book's opening line says that Amos is going to speak against Israel. But watch how this works. As Amos is naming all of these neighboring nations, you can go look at a map and see that he is creating a circle And when he's done, Israel lies right in the centre like a target in crosshairs And on Israel, Amos unleashes a poetic accusation that's three times longer and more intense than any of these others.",

The party's over,\" Amos says. \"God is done putting up with you.\" And so the opening of the next section explains why. God says, I chose you, Israel, from among all the families of the earth. This is an allusion to Genesis 12 How God had called the family of Abraham to become God\u2019s blessing to all of the nations And so then God says, \"So this is why I will punish you for all of your sins.\" Israel had a great calling, which came with great responsibility, and so their sin and rebellion brings great consequences.

God says a real relationship with Him will transform a person's relationships And so Amos' call to true worship is to let justice flow like a river\nand righteousness like a never failing stream. Now these two words,\nthey're super important for Amos and actually all of the prophets. So righteousness, or in Hebrew \u201ctsedaqah\", refers to a standard of right equitable\nrelationships between people no matter their social differences. And justice or in Hebrew \"mishpat\" refers to concrete actions that you take to correct\ninjustice and create righteousness.

And in the prophet's view,\nthe worship of these gods always led to injustice. Because these gods don't require the same\ndegree of justice and righteousness as the God of Israel. Not to mention that these gods\nwere immoral themselves, not the God of Israel;\nHe's different. So He can say in one place, \"Seek Me that you may live.\" And then right\nafter that say to Israel, \"Seek good, not evil that you may live.\u201d So true\nworship of the Creator, God of Israel, it's synonymous with doing good, with\ngenerosity, and with justice.

It\u2019s a series of divine judgement poems against the ancient people of Edom. Which was a nation that neighbored Israel on the other side of the Dead Sea. However, there is way way more going on here. So first, here is the backstory. The people of Edom were unique because they had a shared ancestry with the Israelites, they both belonged to the family of Abraham, who with Sarah, had their son Isaac, who with his wife Rebekah, had two sons Jacob and Esau. Now the book of Genesis told us the story of these two brothers and to say the very least, they had a tense relationship. They each later received the names Israel and Edom which eventually became the name of the families that descended from them and these families replayed the same difficult relationship of their ancestors.

So when Israel was invaded and conquered by Babylon, the people of Edom took advantage by plundering other Israelite cities, and then capturing, and even killing Israelite refugees. Now in other prophetic books, God held Israel\u2019s neighbors accountable for this kind of violence and so here Obadiah does the same for Edom. The short book has two halves. The first part is a series of accusations against the leaders of Edom, specifically for their pride and self-exaltation. Literally, as they lived up high in the desert rocks but also metaphorically, they truly believed they were superior to the Israelites, and it\u2019s that pride that led the Edomites to not just stand idly by when Babylon came to destroy Jerusalem but actually to participate in the destruction. And so God says through Obadiah that Edom will be brought down from their height and destroyed. As they have done to Israel, so it will be done to them. Now right when you think you\u2019re going to hear more about how Edom will meet its doom, the topic suddenly shifts, in verse 15.",

And Obadiah says that all prideful nations that act like Edom will face God\u2019s justice in the same way, they\u2019ll fall from their prideful heights and come to ruin. Now the combination of these two sections, one about Edom, the other one about all nations, shows us why Obadiah was so interested in this tiny southern neighbor of Israel. Obadiah sees Edom\u2019s pride and fall as an example, an image of how God will one day confront the pride of all nations and bring about their fall too. It\u2019s hardly coincidental that in Hebrew, the word Edom, or Edom, is spelled with the exact same letters as the word humanity, or in Hebrew, Adam.",

Joel had painted a picture of what will happen after the day of the Lord against all nations. He said that God would perform a new act of salvation in Jerusalem and that all who humble themselves and call upon Him would be delivered And in the conclusion of Amos, he said that after the day of the Lord has judged Israel\u2019s evil, God would raise up the house of David and build a new kingdom for Israel that would include Edom and all the nations called by My name And so the book of Obadiah has been placed right after Joel and then Amos to expand on these very promises about the hope of God\u2019s kingdom over all of the nations.

They're quite happy to offer promises of God's\nprotection to anyone who can afford to pay them. \"No\" Micah says \"God has\nwithdrawn His protection from Israel.\" In the second section of accusations, Micah\ndescribes even more how Israel's leaders and prophets have together committed grave injustice. They run the land through bribery. They've bent justice to favor the wealthy.",

And so they will come to ruin. However, the book ends with another\npowerful note of hope. Israel is personified as an individual,\nwho's sitting alone in shame and defeat. It's a clear image of Israel's\ndestruction and exile. And this individual is watching for God's mercy\nand he begs God to listen and forgive. But why? Why should God listen to and forgive this\nfaithless and rebellious people? Well the poet offers two reasons:\nfirst, he says because of God's character. \"Who is a God like You, who forgives\nsin and pardons rebellion?\"",

The Assyrians arose as one of the\nworld's first great empires. And their expansion into Israel resulted in the\ntotal destruction and exile of the northern kingdom and its tribes. The Assyrian armies were violent and destructive on a scale that the world had never seen before. And so Israel and its neighbors were\nawaiting the downfall of Assyria, which eventually came in the year 612 BC. The Babylonians rose up and\nbegan a rebellion that overtook Nineveh and brought down the Assyrian Empire. And so chapter 2 depicts the\nfall of Nineveh in vivid poetry. And chapter 3 then explores the\ndownfall of the empire as a whole. But, this book isn't just an angry\ntirade against Israel's enemies. The introductory chapter shows us that there\nis way, way more going on here. The book opens with an incomplete\nalphabet poem that begin by describing a powerful appearance of God's glory.",

And the poem opens by quoting from\nthe famous line of God's self-description after the golden calf incident,\nin the book of Exodus chapter 34, \"The Lord is slow to anger, He's great in power,\nHe won't leave evil unpunished.\" And so the rest of the poem goes back and forth, contrasting the fate of the arrogant violent\nnations with the fate of God's faithful remnant. When God brings down all the arrogant empires, He will provide refuge for those\nwho humble themselves before Him. Now here's what's really interesting. Is that you thought this book was only about Assyria but Nahum actually nowhere mentions Nineveh or Assyria in chapter 1. And when he describes\nthe downfall of the bad guys, he uses Isaiah's language \nabout the fall of Babylon (which happened much later in history). And not only that, Nahum also\ndescribes the downfall of the bad guys as good news for\nthe remnant of God's people.",

As an image of how God is at work\nin history in every age. How He won't allow the arrogant or\nviolent empires of our world to endure forever. So the message of Nahum is\nactually very similar to that of Daniel. Assyria stands in a long line of\nviolent empires throughout history. And Nineveh's fate is a memorial to God's commitment\nto bring down the violent and the arrogant in every age. With this perspective\nfrom the opening chapter, the book then returns to its focus on Assyria. And so chapter 2 describes the Battle of Nineveh\nand the overthrow of the city in progressive stages. So first, we see the front line of\nBabylonian soldiers. And then we read about the charge of the chariots. And then the chaos on the city walls\nas the city is breached.

Human history is filled with tribes\nand nations elevating themselves and using violence to take what they want,\nresulting in the death of the innocent.

We're told that this is a prayer of Habakkuk and it begins by Habakkuk pleading with God to act now in the present, like He has in the past in bringing down corrupt nations And what follows is a very ancient poem It first describes a powerful terrifying appearance of God It's very similar to the opening poems of Micah and Nahum And similar to the appearance of God at Mount Sinai in the book of Exodus There's cloud and fire and earthquake When the Creator shows up to confront human evil, everybody will be paying attention.

Worshipping other gods was too entrenched in the life of the people and it ended up that Josiah's pride led him to a tragic death on the battlefield, as he set Jerusalem on a collision course with Babylon. And Zephaniah? He had seen all of this coming. For years he had been warning the leaders of Jerusalem. And this little book is a collection of his poetry summarizing his message. It's designed to have three (3) main parts. The first focuses on the day of the Lord's judgement coming on Judah and Jerusalem.

All the leaders who perpetrated injustice, all the economic centres where crooked lending and borrowing took place, all of it will be gone along with the city's walls.

Now it's interesting that Zephaniah never mentions whose army God's going to use to bring this judgement. Now we know from the other prophets Micah or Habakkuk that it's Babylon.

His justice is about His passion to protect and to rescue His world from the horror of human evil and violence. God won't tolerate the horrible things that humans do to each other and to His world. But He brings this justice in order to restore, in order to create a world where people can flourish in safety and peace, because of His love. And so Zepheniah forces us to hold together these two aspects of God's character. His justice and His love. And he wants us to discover that together, they contain the future hope of our World. And that is what the book of Zepheniah is all about.",

For centuries, Hebrew prophets had been accusing Israel of breaking their covenant with God through idolatry and injustice. They warned that God would send the great empire of Babylon to take out Jerusalem, destroy the temple and haul off the people into exile. It all happened in the year 587 BC but that was not the end of the story. The prophets also believed that there was still hope and that God would one day bring back a transformed remnant of his people Israel to live in a new Jerusalem where God's presence would live in their midst. When we turn to Haggai, the year is 520 BC, nearly 70 years after the exile. The Babylonian Empire has recently collapsed and the world is now ruled by the Persians. They allowed the return of any exiled Israelites who wanted to go back to Jerusalem, which still lay in ruins.",

Remember the story from the book of Ezra chapters 1 to 6 . So, our hopes are high and the future seems very bright. But it is not, actually, at least from Haggai's point of view. The book consists of four sections that summarize Haggai's message given to the people of Jerusalem over the course of four months. He opens by accusing the people of misplaced priorities. So, yes, they have come back to Jerusalem  but they are spending all of their time and resources rebuilding their own fancy houses while the temple still lay in ruins from its destruction from 70 years ago. So Haggai asks, are your own houses really more important than your allegiance to God? This neglect, Haggai says, is tantamount to the covenant rebellion of their ancestors, which is why the land is still unproductive, why they have been struck with famine and drought. Here, Haggai is quoting from the list of covenant curses in the book of Deuteronomy.",

In the next section Haggai follows up one month later. He addresses some problems of shattered expectations among the people. The temple that they are rebuilding is really pretty unimpressive. It is nothing compared to the glory of the temple Solomon built here some 500 years earlier. So morale was really low for finishing the project. So Haggai reminds the people of the great prophetic promises of the future kingdom of God and about this temple. He draws from the earlier prophets especially Isaiah and Micah about the new Jerusalem and that it would be the place from which God would redeem the whole world and where all nations would come and participate in God's kingdom, resulting in an era of peace. So the temple plays a key role in God's plans for the future. Haggai calls on the people to work in hope despite the disappointing circumstances.",

Remember all the key ideas from the book of Leviticus. He says if someone goes and touches a dead body and becomes ritually impure or marked by death and then they go and touch some food, is that food impure too? The priests, knowing the book of Leviticus, say, \"Yes, it is impure.\" Then Haggai turns this into a parable. He says this is how it is with the people of Israel and what they are putting their hands to in rebuilding the temple. If the current generation does not humble themselves, if they do not turn from injustice and apathy then Haggai says whatever they build with their hands, including this new temple will be impure too. Haggai's challenge is that it is only by true repentance and covenant faithfulness that their building efforts will result in God bringing his kingdom and blessing. So, in a sense, Israel's future lay in their hands. God is waiting for his people to be faithful.",

He is going to make the new Jerusalem the center of His glorious international kingdom. From there He will confront and defeat evil among the nations. He reminds people of the defeat of Pharaoh's army and the exodus story. God will fulfill here his promise to David and establish the King from his line. In Haggai's day, that was represented by Zerubbabel. And so the book ends with the choice of a bright future just hanging there So the question is, will Haggai's generation be faithful to God? Will they experience the fulfillment of all these promises? Will Zerubbabel be faithful? Will he turn out to be the messianic king? You have to just keep reading into the final two books of the prophets Zechariah and Malachi to find out.",

Now long ago Jeremiah, the prophet, had said that Israel's exile would last for seventy years and that afterwards God would restore His presence to a new temple and bring his kingdom and the rule of the Messiah over all nations. The dates at the beginning of this book tell us that those seventy years are almost up. But life back in the land was hard, and it seems like none of these promises were going to come true. why? And the book of Zechariah offers an explanation. It has a fairly clear design, there is an introduction, which sets the tone for a large collection of Zechariah\u00b4s dream visions and that's concluded by chapter 7 and 8. And then this is followed by two more large collections of poetry and prophecy let's just dive in and see how the book works.",

The next large section is a collection of eight nighttime visions that Zechariah experiences and just to prepare you, these are full of very bizarre strange images, a lot like your dreams. The idea that God communicates to people through symbolic dreams is very old and goes back to the book of Genesis The dreams of Jacob or Joseph or Pharaoh, these gave meaning to current events at the time, but they also gave a window into the future and so Zechariah has his own dreams now and they've been arranged in this cool symmetrical design.",

And so the question now arises, the seventy years of Israel's exile are almost up is now the time for the messianic kingdom in Jerusalem and God responds by saying that He is determined to fulfill those promises but He leaves the question of timing unanswered the second and seventh visions are paired because they're both reflections on Israel's  past sin, that led up to the exile. So, the second vision is about these horns, that symbolize the nations that attacked and then scattered Israel.

The first dispute starts when God says that he still loves his covenant people, despite their failures. Israel rudely objects saying, \"How have you shown us any love?\" So God reminds them of how he graciously chose the family of Jacob their ancestor to become the carrier of God's covenant promises instead of Esau, his brother, and the family that came from him, who eventually came to ruin. Remember the stories from Genesis and the book of Obadiah. So right from this first dispute, Israel is exposed as suspicious, doubting God's love and faithfulness. The second dispute exposes a problem with Israel's Second Temple. God accuses the people of despising and defiling the temple The people fire back, \"How have we despised you?\"",

From top to bottom, God's people have proven faithless. In the third dispute God accuses the Israelite men of treachery against him and their wives, which, of course, they deny. God exposes the toxic combination of idolatry and divorce taking place. You have Israelite men marrying non-israelite women and then adopting the worship of their wives' ancestral gods into their homes. Remember the story from Nehemiah chapter 13. So Malachi connects this to a wave of men divorcing  their wives for no good reason. The people are all fine with this. Malachi says, \"No, it is a betrayal of your covenant with God.\" So Malachi transitions into the second set of disputes that confront Israel's rebellion. The fourth dispute begins with the Israelites accusing God of neglect saying, where is the God of justice?",

In the fifth dispute, God calls the people to turn back to him, to which the people say, \"How can we turn back?\" So God confronts their selfishness. He shows how they have stopped offering a tithe of their income to the temple. That word \"tithe\" just means \"one-tenth\". It is the amount of their income and produce that Israelites were to annually donate to support the temple and its priests. The practice is laid out in different parts of the Torah. We know from Malachi and from the book of Nehemiah that the people were neglecting this responsibility. So the temple was falling into disrepair. So God confronts them.

They love to get together and talk about how to honor God and serve Him. So God orders that a scroll of remembrance be written for these people so that they can read the scroll and remember God's character and promises. Malachi is reflecting here on the divine gift of the scriptures, how they point us to the past to remember what God has done in order to inspire faithfulness and hope for the future which leads to the conclusion of the book. It picks up and develops the imagery of the fourth dispute about the coming day of the Lord, but it develops it further.

There's the poems of Asaph, or from the\nsons of Korah, and some from other worship leaders in the temple. Even Solomon and\nMoses have their own poems and nearly one third of these are anonymous. Now many of these poems came to be used\nby the choirs that  sang in Israel's temple. But the Book of Psalms is actually\nnot a hymn book. At some point in the period after Israel's exile to Babylon,\nthese ancient poems were gathered together and intentionally arranged into\nthe Book of Psalms before us.

Psalm 1 celebrates how blessed the\nperson is who meditates on the Torah, prayerfully reading it day and night and\nthen obeying it. Now the word \"Torah,\" it simply means \"teaching\" and more specifically it\ncame to refer to the five books of Moses that begin the Old Testament.

And so together these two poems tell us that the Book of\nPsalms is designed to be the prayer book of God's people as they strive to be\nfaithful to the commands of the Torah as they hope and wait for the future\nMessianic Kingdom. Now with these two themes introduced, we can start to see\nhow the smaller books have been designed as well around these two ideas. So for\nexample, Book One has, right at the center, a collection of poems, Psalms 15 through 24,\nthat opens and closes with a call to covenant faithfulness. And then, in Psalms 16 to18, we find a depiction of David as a model of this kind of\nfaithfulness. So he calls out to God to deliver him and God elevates him as King.",

Book Two opens with two poems that\nare united in their hope for a future return to the temple in Zion and this\nis the image closely associated with the hope of the Messianic Kingdom. Then\nBook Two closes with a poem that depicts the future reign of the\nMessianic King over all of the nations.

And so the poet ends by asking God to never forget his promise to David. Book Four is designed to respond to this crisis of exile. So the opening poem\nreturns us back to Israel's roots with a prayer of Moses and he does what he did\non Mount Sinai after the Golden Calf incident, which is to call upon God to\nshow mercy.

Now here's one more thing\nthat you are likely going to miss if you don't read this book in order. There's lots of different kinds of poems\nin the book of Psalms but they all basically fall into two big categories--\neither poems of lament or poems of praise. Poems of lament expressed pain,\nconfusion, and anger about how horrible the world is and how horrible things are\nhappening to the poet and so these poems draw attention to what's wrong in the\nworld and they ask God to do something about it. There's a lot of these in the\nbook, which tells us something important-- that lament is an appropriate response to\nthe evil that we see in our world. But what you'll notice is that lament poems\npredominate earlier in the book, in books 1 through 3.",

They retell stories of what\nGod has done in our lives and thank God for it. In Books Four and Five you'll\nnotice that praise poems come to outnumber lament poems and it all culminates\nin that five-part hallelujah conclusion. So this shift from lament to praise, this\nis profound, and it tells us something about the nature of prayer. As we hoped\nfor the Messianic Kingdom, as the book teaches us to do, this will create\ntension for us as we look out on the tragic state of our world and of our\nlives. And so the psalms teach us not to ignore the pain of our lives but at the\nsame time, Biblical faith is forward-looking--\nlooking to the promise of God's future Messianic Kingdom. And so Torah and\nMessiah, lament and praise, faith and hope. That's what the Book of Psalms is\nall about.",

Here wisdom has been\npoetically personified as a woman who calls out to humanity to pay attention\nand to seek her. Wisdom says that she is woven into the fabric of the universe\nand so wherever you see people making wise decisions they are relying on her.

And this whole debate has focused on three questions: \"Is\nGod truly just in character?\"",

As we're going\nto see, Job and the friends, they're working from a huge assumption about\nwhat God's justice ought to look like in the world, namely that every single thing\nthat happens in the universe should operate according to the strict\nprinciple of justice. So if you're a wise, good person and you honor God, good\nthings will happen to you. God will reward you. But if you're evil and stupid\nand do sinful things, bad things will happen to you. God will punish you. Now\nJob's constant arguments throughout his speeches is this: first of all, that he's\ninnocent and so the implication of that is that his suffering is not a divine\npunishment. Now we know from the prologue, both of these things are true. Remember,\nGod Himself said Job is righteous and blameless. And so Job concludes his argument\nby accusing God. God either doesn't run the world according to justice, or even\nworse, God Himself is simply unjust. The friends, on the other hand, they beg to\ndiffer.",

In fact, he gets so fed up with the friends that he eventually just gives up\non them. He takes up his case directly with God. Now something to be aware of is\nthat Job, he's on an emotional roller coaster in these poems. He used to think\nthat God is just, but now he can't reconcile that with his suffering. And so,\nin some outbursts Job will accuse God of being a bully. Once he even declares that\nGod has orchestrated all the injustice in the world. But the moment he utters that\nthought, he's terrified of it because he wants to hope and believe that God is\ntruly just. Job is all over the place in this section.",

It may not be punishment\nfor sin in the past. God might inflict suffering as a warning to\nhelp people avoid sin in the future. Or God might use pain and suffering to\nbuild character or to teach people valuable lessons. Elihu doesn't claim to know why\nJob is suffering but one thing he is certain of: Job is wrong to accuse God of being\nunjust. Job doesn't even respond to Elihu and the dialogues come to a close .

Was Job ever around when God architected the earth or organized the\nconstellations? Has Job ever commanded the sunrise or controlled the weather?

His view of the world is very limited and so what looks like\ndivine injustice from Job's point of view needs to be seen in an infinitely\nlarger context. Job is simply not in a position to make such a huge accusation\nabout God. After the virtual tour, God asks Job if he would like to micromanage\nthe world for a day according to the strict principle of justice that Job and\nhis friends assume; punishing every evil deed of every person at every moment with\nprecise retribution. The fact is that carrying out justice in\na world like ours, it's extremely complex. It's never black and white like Job and\nthe friends seem to think. Which leads to God's last point.

They're not meant to be dissected, or taken apart. They're meant to be read as a flowing whole and simply enjoyed.

So this is the greatest song of all songs.

So the woman calls out, or she'll wake up from a dream and go looking for her lover, and more than once they'll find each other, they'll embrace.

Love is as strong as death, its passions are as severe as the grave, its flashes are of fire, a divine flame. Many waters cannot extinguish love, rivers cannot sweep it away. If one were to give all the wealth of ones house for love, he would be utterly scorned. The poem highlights the power and intensity of love \u2013 how it's both beautiful, but also dangerous.

He calls to hear her voice, she begs him to run away with her, and that's how the book ends. Just totally open-ended. But that's a lot like love! Which never truly concludes, because there's always more to discover and pursue in your beloved. And so true love has no end. And neither does this book.

And this interpretation was inspired by Paul's words in Ephesians 5: \u2013 that a Christian husband's love for his wife is a symbol of Christ's love for the Church. What's interesting is that in the last hundred years, archaeological discoveries among Israel's ancient neighbors and Egypt and Babylon, has turned up all kinds of ancient love poetry that's very similar in language and imagery to the Song of Songs. We see that love poetry was a meaningful part of Israel's cultural environment, which has led most scholars today to view the Song of Songs as what it presents itself to be: an arrangement of Israelite love poetry reflecting on the divine gift of love. But, that doesn't mean it's only ancient love poetry. There's a key feature of these poems that sticks out when you read them as a part of the Old Testament.",

And so God uses his integrity\ncombined with Ruth's boldness to save Naomi and her family. So this story brilliantly\nexplores the interplay of God's purposes and will with human decision and will. God weaves together the faithful obedience of his people to bring about\nhis redemptive purposes in the world. And that leads to the real end of the story.",

                "text": "the Book of Lamentations it's a unique book in\u00a0\nthe Old Testament that contains five poems from\u00a0\u00a0 an anonymous author who survived and is now\u00a0\nreflecting back on the Babylonian siege of\u00a0\u00a0 Jerusalem and the destruction and exile that\u00a0\nfollowed remember the whole story from the\u00a0\u00a0 book of second Kings the fall of Jerusalem in\u00a0\nthe Exile was the most horrendous catastrophe\u00a0\u00a0 in Israel's history up to this point so remember\u00a0\nGod had promised Abraham the land he'd given David\u00a0\u00a0 victory to make Jerusalem Israel's capital and\u00a0\nfrom David came the royal line of kings you had\u00a0\u00a0 God's presence there in the temple and that's\u00a0\nwhere the priests maintained the rituals of\u00a0\u00a0 Israel's worship and after five hundred years of\u00a0\nall of this history in the summer of 587 BC the\u00a0\u00a0 city fell to Babylon it was all decimated and gone\u00a0\nand so the Book of Lamentations is a memorial to\u00a0\u00a0 the pain and confusion of the Israelites that\u00a0\nfollowed this destruction now the lament poems\u00a0\u00a0 found here are not unique in the Bible there's\u00a0\nlots of them in the Book of Psalms and these\u00a0\u00a0 biblical poems of lament they do a number of\u00a0\nthings they're a form of protest they're a way\u00a0\u00a0 of drawing everybody's attention including God's\u00a0\nattention to the horrible things that happen in\u00a0\u00a0 this world that should not be tolerated they're a\u00a0\nway of processing emotion so in these poems God's\u00a0\u00a0 people vent their anger and dismay at the ruin\u00a0\ncaused by people's sin and selfishness and these\u00a0\u00a0 poems are placed a voice confusion suffering\u00a0\nmakes us ask questions about God's character\u00a0\u00a0 and promises and none of this is looked down on in\u00a0\nthe Bible just the opposite these poems of lament\u00a0\u00a0 give a sacred dignity to human suffering and so\u00a0\nthese human words of grief that are addressed to\u00a0\u00a0 God have now become part of God's Word to his\u00a0\npeople the design of these five poems is very\u00a0\u00a0 intentional it's part of the book's message so\u00a0\nchapters 1 through 4 are called acrostics which\u00a0\u00a0 means alphabet poems each poetic verse begins\u00a0\nwith a new letter of the Hebrew alphabet which\u00a0\u00a0 is made up of 22 letters now this very ordered\u00a0\nand linear structure it's in stark contrast to\u00a0\u00a0 the disorder of the pain and the confused grief\u00a0\nthat's explored in these poems so it's like Israel\u00a0\u00a0 suffering is explored a-to-z and is trying to\u00a0\nexpress something that is in Express chapter's\u00a0\u00a0 wanted to each have one verse per letter giving\u00a0\nthem a really similar design but the themes are\u00a0\u00a0 very different so chapter 1 focuses on the grief\u00a0\nand shame of a figure called lady Zion the poet\u00a0\u00a0 personifies the city of Jerusalem as a widow also\u00a0\ncalled the daughter of Zion and she sits alone\u00a0\u00a0 she's bereaved of her loved ones devastated no one\u00a0\ncomes to comfort her it's a very powerful metaphor\u00a0\u00a0 and then lady Zion speaks she calls on the Lord\u00a0\nto notice her fate and through this image the poet\u00a0\u00a0 he's showing that the city's destruction brought\u00a0\na level of psychological trauma on the Israelites\u00a0\u00a0 that can only be expressed as the experience of\u00a0\na funeral and the death of a loved one chapter 2\u00a0\u00a0 focuses on the fall of Jerusalem and how it was a\u00a0\nconsequence of Israel's sin and was brought about\u00a0\u00a0 by God's wrath which is a key word in this poem\u00a0\nnow it's important to remember that in the Bible\u00a0\u00a0 God's wrath is not spontaneous volatile anger the\u00a0\nbiblical poets and prophets they used this word to\u00a0\u00a0 talk about God's justice so Israel had entered\u00a0\na covenant agreement with God and for centuries\u00a0\u00a0 they've been violating it by worshiping other gods\u00a0\nperpetrating injustice so pressing the poor and\u00a0\u00a0 so yes God is slow to anger but he eventually\u00a0\ndoes get angry at human evil and he will bring\u00a0\u00a0 his just anger in the form of punishment in the\u00a0\ncase of Jerusalem this involved allowing Babylon\u00a0\u00a0 to come and conquer the city and so this poem\u00a0\nis acknowledging that God's wrath is justified\u00a0\u00a0 but this doesn't keep the poet from lamenting and\u00a0\nasking God to show compassion once again chapter 3\u00a0\u00a0 breaks this design pattern by having three verses\u00a0\nper letter so it's the longest poem in the book\u00a0\u00a0 and the voice is that of a lonely man speaking out\u00a0\nof his suffering and grief as a representative of\u00a0\u00a0 the whole people and what's interesting is that\u00a0\nthis chapter is full of language that's drawn from\u00a0\u00a0 other parts of the Old Testament from the laments\u00a0\nof Job and from other important lament Psalms and\u00a0\u00a0 even from the suffering servant poems in Isaiah\u00a0\nand the poet sees his hardship as a form of God's\u00a0\u00a0 justice like chapter 2 said but paradoxically\u00a0\nthis is what gives the poet hope and it leads\u00a0\u00a0 him to offer the only hopeful words in the whole\u00a0\nbook because of the Lord's covenant faithfulness\u00a0\u00a0 weed Parrish His mercies never fail they're new\u00a0\nevery morning how great is your faithfulness Oh\u00a0\u00a0 God so I say to myself the Lord is my inheritance\u00a0\ntherefore I will put my hope in him so the poet\u00a0\u00a0 reasons if God is consistent enough to bring\u00a0\nhis justice on human evil then he'll also be\u00a0\u00a0 consistent with his covenant promise to not allow\u00a0\nevil to get the final word and so for this poet\u00a0\u00a0 God's judgment is the seedbed of hope for the\u00a0\nfuture chapter 4 goes back to the same alphabet\u00a0\u00a0 structure as chapters 1 and 2 and it's a vivid\u00a0\nand disturbing depiction of the two-year siege\u00a0\u00a0 in Jerusalem and it contrasts how things used to\u00a0\nbe in Jerusalem of the past and how terrible they\u00a0\u00a0 became in the siege so children used to laugh and\u00a0\nplay in the streets but now they beg for food the\u00a0\u00a0 wealthy used to eat lavish meals but now they\u00a0\neat whatever they can find in the dirt and the\u00a0\u00a0 royal leaders used to be full of splendor but now\u00a0\nthey're famished and dirty and unrecognizable and\u00a0\u00a0 the anointed king from the line of David has\u00a0\nbeen captured and dragged away so the poem's\u00a0\u00a0 power comes from the shock of these contrasts and\u00a0\nit's exploring the depth of the suffering that\u00a0\u00a0 is real brought on itself now the final poem is\u00a0\nunique because it breaks the design pattern it's\u00a0\u00a0 the same length as all of the other alphabet\u00a0\npoems but the alphabet order is gone it's like\u00a0\u00a0 the poet can't hold it together anymore and his\u00a0\ngrief has exploded back into chaos the poem is\u00a0\u00a0 a communal prayer for God's mercy Israel begs God\u00a0\nnot to ignore their suffering or abandon to them\u00a0\u00a0 and the poem offers a long list of all of the\u00a0\ndifferent kinds of people who were devastated\u00a0\u00a0 by the fall of the city they ask God not to forget\u00a0\nthese people and they lament on behalf of others\u00a0\u00a0 giving voice to their pain suffering in silence\u00a0\nis just not a virtue in this book God's people\u00a0\u00a0 are not asked to deny their emotions but voice\u00a0\ntheir protests to vent their feelings and pour\u00a0\u00a0 it all out before God the book ends with something\u00a0\nof a paradox the poet acknowledges that God is the\u00a0\u00a0 eternal king of the world but also that Israel's\u00a0\ncircumstances make them feel like God is nowhere\u00a0\u00a0 to be found and so the final words the book leave\u00a0\nthis tension totally unresolved it asks unless\u00a0\u00a0 you've totally rejected us in the book ends the\u00a0\npoet doesn't offer a nice neat conclusion much\u00a0\u00a0 like our own experiences of pain and suffering the\u00a0\nstory of the Bible doesn't end here but this very\u00a0\u00a0 important book shows us how lament and prayer and\u00a0\ngrief are a crucial part of the journey of faith\u00a0\u00a0 of God's people in a broken world and that's\u00a0\nwhat the Book of Lamentations is all about",

                "text": "the book of ecclesiastes it's part of the Bible's\u00a0\nwisdom literature and it opens with this line\u00a0\u00a0 the words of qohelet the son of David King in\u00a0\nJerusalem now in Hebrew the word qohelet means\u00a0\u00a0 someone who has gathered people together and in\u00a0\nthis case it's to learn so it's often translated\u00a0\u00a0 in English as teacher and the teacher is said\u00a0\nto be a son or a descendant of King David and\u00a0\u00a0 so there are different views about who this figure\u00a0\nmight have been many think that it refers to King\u00a0\u00a0 Solomon others - maybe one of the later kings\u00a0\nof David's line and still others think that it's\u00a0\u00a0 actually a later Israelite teacher who has adopted\u00a0\na Solomon like persona as a teaching aid whichever\u00a0\u00a0 of these views is correct the key thing is to\u00a0\nrecognize that the teacher is a character in the\u00a0\u00a0 book and is different than the author of the book\u00a0\nwho remains anonymous so we do hear the teacher's\u00a0\u00a0 voice for most of the book but it's actually a\u00a0\ndifferent voice the author who introduces us to\u00a0\u00a0 the teacher in the first sentence and then at\u00a0\nthe end concludes the book by summarizing and\u00a0\u00a0 evaluating everything the teacher just said so the\u00a0\nauthor is someone who wants us to hear all that\u00a0\u00a0 the teacher has to say and then help us process\u00a0\nit and form our own conclusion so what does the\u00a0\u00a0 teacher have to say well the author summarizes the\u00a0\nteachers basic message at the beginning and right\u00a0\u00a0 at the end and it's heavily heavily everything is\u00a0\nutterly Hevel now most English Bibles translate\u00a0\u00a0 this word have alas meaningless but that doesn't\u00a0\nquite capture the heart of the idea in Hebrew\u00a0\u00a0 Hevel literally means vapor or smoke and the\u00a0\nteacher uses this word thirty-eight times in\u00a0\u00a0 the book as a metaphor to describe how life is\u00a0\nfirst of all temporary or fleeting like a wisp\u00a0\u00a0 of smoke but secondly also how life is an enigma\u00a0\nor a paradox like smoke it appears solid but when\u00a0\u00a0 you try and grab on to it there's nothing\u00a0\nthere so there's so much beauty or goodness\u00a0\u00a0 in the world but just when you're enjoying it\u00a0\ntragedy strikes and it all seems to blow away\u00a0\u00a0 or we all have a strong sense of justice but all\u00a0\nthe time bad things happen to good people so life\u00a0\u00a0 is constantly it's unpredictable it's unstable\u00a0\nor in the teachers words like chasing after the\u00a0\u00a0 wind Hevel now that's kind of a downer so why is\u00a0\nhe saying all of this the author's basic goal is\u00a0\u00a0 to target all of the ways that we try to build\u00a0\nmeaning and purpose in our lives apart from God\u00a0\u00a0 and he lets the teacher deconstruct these so the\u00a0\nauthor thinks we spend most of our time investing\u00a0\u00a0 energy and emotion in things that ultimately have\u00a0\nno lasting meaning or significance and he lets the\u00a0\u00a0 teacher give us a hard lesson in reality you can\u00a0\nsee this most clearly in the opening and closing\u00a0\u00a0 poems which focus first of all on time and then\u00a0\non death so the teacher says you can spend your\u00a0\u00a0 whole life working and achieving because you think\u00a0\nthat makes your life meaningful you should really\u00a0\u00a0 stop and consider the march of time for all of\u00a0\nthe human effort that takes place in the world\u00a0\u00a0 nothing really ever changes so short we develop\u00a0\ntechnology and we build nations that rise and\u00a0\u00a0 fall but go climb a mountain and see if it cares\u00a0\nit was there long before any of us and it will\u00a0\u00a0 be here long after I mean no one's even going\u00a0\nto remember you or anything you did 100 years\u00a0\u00a0 from now but that mountain it'll still be there\u00a0\nand the ocean will still be breaking on the beach\u00a0\u00a0 and the Sun will still rise and set and so time\u00a0\nwill eventually erase you and me and everything\u00a0\u00a0 that we care about and if that's not disheartening\u00a0\nenough the teacher also can't stop talking about\u00a0\u00a0 death all the way through the book but especially\u00a0\nin this poem near the end he says death is the\u00a0\u00a0 great equalizer and it renders meaningless most\u00a0\nof our daily activities it devours the wise and\u00a0\u00a0 the fool the rich and the poor no matter who you\u00a0\nare what you've done good or bad we're all going\u00a0\u00a0 to die and it's inescapable so with these two\u00a0\nideas in hand the teacher goes on to consider\u00a0\u00a0 all the activities and false hopes that we invest\u00a0\nour lives in to find meaning and significance like\u00a0\u00a0 wealth or career or social status or pleasure\u00a0\nso you think working hard is going to make life\u00a0\u00a0 worth it think about the stress and the toll\u00a0\nthat that takes on you all the anxiety and the\u00a0\u00a0 sleepless nights and by the time you actually earn\u00a0\nsome wealth you're going to be too old to enjoy\u00a0\u00a0 anyway and then by the time that you have to pass\u00a0\nit on to someone they may not even be someone who\u00a0\u00a0 cares about anything that you did or maybe you\u00a0\nthink pleasure is going to make life worth it for\u00a0\u00a0 you go for it you know live for your vacations\u00a0\nlive for the weekend party Monday always comes\u00a0\u00a0 Hevel Hevel everything is utterly Hevel so what\u00a0\ndoes the teacher advocate then that we become\u00a0\u00a0 pure hedonist or relativists well no that would be\u00a0\nlevel two the teacher acknowledges the ideas from\u00a0\u00a0 Proverbs that living by wisdom and the fear of the\u00a0\nLord that these have real advantages on the whole\u00a0\u00a0 life will probably go better for you see but the\u00a0\nproblem is that even living by wisdom and the fear\u00a0\u00a0 of the Lord they're heavily too because they don't\u00a0\nguarantee a good life good people die tragically\u00a0\u00a0 and horrible people live long and prosper there's\u00a0\njust too many exceptions and so even wisdom is a\u00a0\u00a0 Hethel again not meaningless but an enigma wisdom\u00a0\ndoesn't work the way you think it should all of\u00a0\u00a0 the time so what's the way forward in the midst\u00a0\nof all this Hevel and here paradoxically the\u00a0\u00a0 teacher discovers the key to the true enjoyment\u00a0\nof life under the Sun it's accepting Hethel it's\u00a0\u00a0 acknowledging that everything in your life is\u00a0\ntotally out of your control about six different\u00a0\u00a0 times at some of the bleakest moments in his\u00a0\nmonologue the teacher talks about the gift of\u00a0\u00a0 God which is the enjoyment of simple good things\u00a0\nin life like friendship or family a good meal or a\u00a0\u00a0 sunny day you can't control these things you're\u00a0\ncertainly not guaranteed them but that's their\u00a0\u00a0 beauty when I come to adopt a posture of total\u00a0\ntrust in God it frees me to simply enjoy my life\u00a0\u00a0 as I actually experience it not as I think it\u00a0\nought to be because even my expectations about\u00a0\u00a0 what life ought to be are ultimately Hevel Hevel\u00a0\neverything under the Sun is utterly Hevel and so\u00a0\u00a0 the teachers words come to a close right here at\u00a0\nthe end the author speaks up again and he brings\u00a0\u00a0 it all to a conclusion he says the teachers words\u00a0\nare very important for us to hear he likens them\u00a0\u00a0 to a shepherd staff with a goad a pointy end\u00a0\nwhich might hurt when it pokes you but he says\u00a0\u00a0 the teacher is trying to poke you to get you to\u00a0\nmove in the right direction towards greater wisdom\u00a0\u00a0 the author then warns us that you can actually\u00a0\ntake the teachers words too far and you could\u00a0\u00a0 spend your whole life buried in books trying to\u00a0\nanswer life's existential puzzles don't try he\u00a0\u00a0 says you'll never get there and so instead the\u00a0\nauthor offers his own conclusion and it's this\u00a0\u00a0 fear God and keep his Commandments this is the\u00a0\nwhole duty of humans for God will bring every\u00a0\u00a0 deed into judgment every hidden thing whether\u00a0\ngood or evil and so the author thinks it's good\u00a0\u00a0 to let the teacher challenge your false hopes and\u00a0\nremind you that time and death make most of life\u00a0\u00a0 completely out of your control but what gives\u00a0\nlife true meaning is the hope of God's judgment\u00a0\u00a0 the hope that one day God will clear away all of\u00a0\nthe Hevel and bring true justice to our world and\u00a0\u00a0 it's that hope that should fuel a life of honesty\u00a0\nand integrity before God despite the fact that I\u00a0\u00a0 remain puzzled by most of life's mysteries and\u00a0\nthat's the wisdom of the book of Ecclesiastes",

The story is set over 100 years after the Babylonian\nexile of the Israelites from their land. And while some Jews did return to Jerusalem,\nremember Ezra and Nehemiah, many did not. And so the book of Esther is about a\nJewish community living in Susa, the capital city of the ancient Persian Empire. The main characters in the story are two Jews, Mordecai and then his niece Esther. And then there's the king of Persia who's something of a drunken pushover in this story. And then there's the Persian official Haman, the cunning villain. Now this is a curious book in the Bible mainly for the \nfact that God is never even mentioned, not once, which might strike you as kind of odd. I mean isn't the Bible about God. But this is a brilliant technique by the\nauthor, who's anonymous by the way. It's an invitation to read\nthis story looking for God's activity, and there are signs of it everywhere.",

She refuses and so in a drunken rage\nthe King deposes Vashti and makes the silly decree that all Persian men should now be the masters of their own homes.

Daniel, whose later named Belteshazzar and his three friends, who you probably know by their Babylonian names: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. This book\ntells of their struggles to maintain hope in the land of their conquerors. The book's design seems pretty simple at first-- Chapters one through six contains\nstories about Daniel and his friends in Babylon while chapters 7 through 12\ncontain the visions of Daniel about the future.

And they're recruited to serve in the\nRoyal Palace of Babylon. But they're pressured to give up their\nJewish identity by living and eating like Babylonians and violating the\nJewish food laws found in the Torah. So they refuse and they choose faithfulness to the Torah and it puts them in danger. But God delivers them and they end up\nbeing elevated by the king of Babylon. After this begins the Aramaic section\nwhich you'll see has this really cool symmetrical design. So first the king of Babylon has a dream that it turns out only Daniel is able to interpret. It's about a huge statue made\nof four types of metal and it symbolizes a sequence of kingdoms and the head is Babylon. But then a huge rock comes flying in and it shatters the statue and it becomes this huge mountain.",

After this, \nchapter 3 tells the famous story of Daniel's three friends who refused to bow\ndown and worship a huge idol statue, which like the statue in chapter 2\nrepresents the king in his imperial power. So the friends are persecuted. They're thrown into a fiery furnace. But God delivers them from death and they're exalted by the king who now acknowledges their God is the true one. After this come a pair of stories about two Babylonian kings, the father, Nebuchadnezzar and then his son, Belshazzar. They're both filled with pride because of their imperial power.

This is in contrast with his son\nBelshazzar who doesn't humble himself before God and he's assassinated that\nvery night. Now these two stories draw this imagery from Genesis chapters one and two and Psalm 8 where humans are depicted as the\nroyal image of God. He has given them authority to rule over the beasts of the field, the birds of the air on behalf of God who is the world's true king. But when human kingdoms forget that, when they rebel and make themselves and their power into a \"god,\" they become less than human like violent beasts who will face God's justice. Which brings us to chapter six, the pair of chapter three. And this time it's Daniel who is being persecuted because he refuses to pray and worship the king as a god.

And ironically he cannot understand the dream until an angelic messenger explains it to him. He sees a series of\nfour beasts: the one like a lion then like a bear, then one like a winged\nleopard. Each of these symbolizing an arrogant kingdom. And last of all is a super beast identified as a really evil empire and it has lots of horns -- a common\nsymbol for kings in the Old Testament. And there's one specific horn who is an image of an arrogant king who exalts himself above God and persecute God's people. Now they are symbolized by a figure\ncalled the \"Son of Man\" who is an image for both God's covenant people but also\nfor their King from the line of David.

But an angel comes and informs him that Israel's sin and rebellion has\ncontinued and so their time of exile and oppression will continue on seven times longer than Jeremiah envisioned.

And then the decree is only partially carried out when given a list of some of the men who divorce their wives. The story is very strange for a number of reasons, First of all, God never commanded Ezra to do any of this.",

He's an Israelite official serving in the Persian government and when he hears about the ruined state of Jerusalem's walls he prays and then get permission from the Persian king Artaxerxes to go and rebuild the walls. The King even gives them an armed escort and all these resources. So after arriving in Jerusalem he begins the building project and he too, faces opposition from the people who had already been living around Jerusalem. Once again we face a tension in the story. The contemporary Prophet Zechariah said that the New Jerusalem of God's kingdom would be a city without walls. That God's presence would surround it, that people from all nations would come and join the covenant people. But Nehemiah seems to operate with the opposite vision.",

Ezra and Nehemiah combine forces to bring about a spiritual renewal among the people. They gather all the exiles together for\na festival, they read and teach the Torah to all the people for 7 days, and then they celebrate the ancient feast of tabernacles to remember God's faithfulness from the exodus and the wilderness journeys. Then they offer a confession of their\nsins, they vow themselves to renew the Covenant, follow all the commands of the Torah and they finished with the great celebration over the temple, the walls of Jerusalem.

So Nehemiah, he goes on a rampage, he is beating people up, he's pulling out their hair and he's yelling, \"Obey the commands of the Torah!\" In his final words are a prayer that God would remember him that at least he tried and the book ends.

And while Ezra, Nehemiah, they do their best but their political and social reforms among the people don't address the core issues of their heart. so what the book is pointing out is the same need highlighted by the  prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel. What God's people need is a holistic transformation of their hearts. If they're ever going to love and obey\ntheir God. And so the book ends on a downer, yes but it forces you to keep reading on into the wisdom and prophetic books to find out what is God going to do to fulfill his great covenant promises.

Due\nto scroll lengths the book was divided in two but it was written as one book with\none coherent storyline. Now in our English Bibles, Chronicles comes after\nthe books of Samuel and kings and most of Chronicles is actually repeat content\nfrom those books and so most modern readers when they come to Chronicles\nthey think, \"Wait a minute, I just read all of this!\" and so they skip it, and that's a\nshame because this book is really unique and important in the Bible. In the\ntraditional Jewish ordering of the Bible, Chronicles is actually the last book,\nbecause it summarizes all of the Jewish Scriptures. The first word in the book is Adam,\nthe first character at the beginning of the story, and then the last\nparagraph announces the return of Israel from exile. Now we don't know, who wrote this book,\nbut we can tell from details within it. It was produced by somebody, who lived a couple hundred years after the Israelites returned from the Babylonian\nexile.",

The great prophetic hope was that the\ncity and the temple would be rebuilt, that God would come to live among his\npeople, the Messianic King would come and all the nations would come live under\nhis peaceful rule, and none of that has happened. And so, the author of Chronicles has reshaped these stories of David and Solomon and the Kings of the past in\norder to provide a message of hope for the future. And we'll see that he's designed this book to emphasize two clear themes: First - the hope of the coming Messianic King and second - the hope for a new temple. Let's just dive in and you'll see these\nthemes all over the book 1 Chronicles begins with nine chapters of genealogies\n- long list of names, and you'll read these and think that this is kind of boring, and that may be true for you, but actually\nthey're very, very important.",

And as he does so, he shapes the genealogies to emphasize two key lineages. First is a line of the promised Messianic King. So lots of space is dedicated to tracing the line of Judah that led all the way to King David to whom the Messianic promise was given. And then from David the author traces that line up into his own day. The other family line that receives lots\nof attention here is that of the priesthood, the descendants of Aaron,\nwho of course served in the temple. and so, right from the start,\nyou can see the two main themes. The author's hope of the Messiah coming to build a new temple and it's rooted in these ancient genealogies. Now after that, the author moves into\nthe stories about David, and most of these are going to be\nfamiliar to you from the book of Samuel but again there's some really important differences.",

And not only that. There's also new\nadditional material that you won't find in the book of Samuel, that shows David\nin a very positive light, so there's a large block of chapters,\nwhere David makes preparations for the temple. He arranged his resources and builders\nand Levites and choirs. And not only that. The author also portrays David\nas a Moses like figure. God gives David plans for building the Temple, just as he gave plans to Moses\nfor building the tabernacle. So why all this new material about David? The author's not trying to hide David's flaws. He knows that anybody can go read about them\nin the book of Samuel.",

It's very similar to how Jeremiah or Ezekiel spoke of the coming Messiah\nas a new David. This is most clear and how the author retells the\nstory of God's covenant promise to David in 1 Chronicles 17. When you compare the story with\nits parallel, in 2 Samuel 7, You'll see that the author of Chronicles\nis highlighting that neither David nor Solomon, nor any of the Kings from his line\nwere the Messianic King, and that when the Messiah does come,\nHe will be a king like David. And so for this author,\nthese stories about David from the past are what sustained his hope for the future. After David dies, we move into 2 Chronicles,\nwhich focuses on the kings that lived in Jerusalem. And again, there's lots of overlap with 1 and 2 Kings,\nbut there are many key differences. So the author has left out all of the\nstories about the kings of northern Israel, so he can just focus on the line\nof David.",

But he also adds new stories about kings who\nwere unfaithful to God. They didn't follow the Torah,\nthey led Israel to worship idols, and these kings face horrible consequences,\nall leading up to Israel's exile, a mess of their own making. And so, this whole section becomes a\nseries of character studies, where the author wants later generations of Israelites\nto learn from their family history, and so become faithful to their God and the Torah. Now the book's conclusion is really unique, too. At the very end of the book, the king of the Persians, his name's\nCyrus, and he tells the Israelites that they can go back home, return from exile,\nrebuild the city and the temple. And he says (last line of the book) : \"... whoever there is among you, of all his people,\nmay the Lord his God be with him and let him go up...\" and that's how the book ends,\nwith an incomplete sentence!",

And so, the Book of Chronicles, the final book of the Jewish Scriptures, it ends by pointing forward. It calls God's people to look back in order to look ahead, because the past has become the source of hope\nfor the future. So, Chronicles concludes the Old\nTestament as a story in search of an ending, and that's what this book is all about.",
