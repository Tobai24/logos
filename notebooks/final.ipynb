In Matthew 5:21-22, He states, \"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, \\'You shall not commit murder.\\' And I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be guilty in the court.\" By equating anger and verbal insults with murder, Jesus emphasizes that such feelings and actions reflect contempt and disregard for others, which is contrary to respecting them as beings created in the image of God.\\n\\nThis connection reveals that the root cause of murder (anger and hatred) is just as significant and detrimental in God\\'s sight. The teaching serves to challenge listeners to examine their hearts and attitudes toward others, suggesting that harboring anger can lead to behaviors that devalue another person\\'s life. Thus, Jesus calls His followers to recognize the weight of their words and emotions, ultimately encouraging them to cultivate respect and love for one another.'"
