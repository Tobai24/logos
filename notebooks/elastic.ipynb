Matthew 1:16 specifically states, \"And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.\" This establishes Joseph in the line of David and highlights his significant role in the Nativity story.\\n\\n2. In Acts 1:23, another Joseph is mentioned, known as Joseph called Barsabas or Justus. This Joseph was considered during the selection of a replacement apostle for Judas Iscariot.\\n\\n3. Psalms 105:17 refers to Joseph, the son of Jacob (Israel), who was sold into Egypt by his brothers. This Joseph is known for his story in Genesis, where he rises to prominence in Egypt and saves his family from famine.\\n\\n4. Matthew 27:57 introduces another Joseph, a rich man from Arimathea, who becomes a disciple of Jesus and requests Jesus\\' body after the crucifixion.\\n\\n5. In 1 Chronicles 25:9, Joseph is mentioned as one of the musical leaders in the temple, indicating a different individual serving in a religious context.\\n\\nIn summary, there are multiple individuals named Joseph throughout the Bible, each playing a different role in the biblical narrative.'"
