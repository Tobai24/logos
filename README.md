## How It Works

**Logos** uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach to provide insightful answers to Bible questions. It works in the following steps:

1. **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question, **Logos** retrieves relevant Bible passages from an Elasticsearch database and relevant video transcripts from **The Bible Project**.
2. **Answer Generation**: Using the **OpenAI GPT-4** model, **Logos** generates a response that combines scripture and insights from the retrieved video transcripts.
3. **Contextual Explanation**: The answer includes explanations of the Bible passages and their application to real-life situations.

## Results

### Example Query

**Question**: _"What does the Bible say about forgiveness?"_

**Response**:

```
"Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you." - Ephesians 4:32

Forgiveness is a central theme in the Bible, often tied to the mercy that God shows His people. The Bible teaches that forgiving others is not just a recommendation but a command. This is also illustrated in [The Bible Project's video on forgiveness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYZ), which discusses the theological significance of mercy and redemption in the biblical narrative.
```
